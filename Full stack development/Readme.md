# Internet:
-   Global network of networks (uses routing for communication)
-   Why routing: not possible to connect every device to every other (IP, TCP, Internet protocols)
-   Internet is a infrastructure that carries (emails, web, file sharing, gaming, streaming)
-   **server and client:**
    -   servers are 24/7 available (up), client: one accessing the server
-   **DNS:**
    -   google.com (browser) -> ISP -> DNS (returns IP)
    -   browser using the address sends request to the server of google!

#   Webpage:
-   files: html (skeleton), css (styles), js (functionality)
