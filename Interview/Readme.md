#   Resume and Interview preparation
-   Professional and eye catching
-   Use graphics, templates, key word optimizations for ATS (applicant tracking system)
-   See the requirements, include!
-   1 to 2 pages long (1 is enough)

##  Important points:
-   no generalization: be specific, don't use progress bars
-   descending chronological order : year of studies
-   include relevant skills, experience, education, certifications
-   focus on combination of functional resume: focus on skill & less on experience and chronological resume: focus on experience
    -  volunteered, worked on something, developed, student club, leadership positions, projects, internships, part time jobs, freelance work
    -  organize: section headings (caps and bold - stand out)
    -  name(phone, email): linked in profile URL
-   DOB, marital status, health, no of children, ethnicity, height & weight (sometimes expected) + photo
-   Use bullet points (when/where): explain skills, experience: less words, more inviting
	-  accomplishments, skills, work, volunteered, projects
    -  consistent bullet points, indentation, avoid sub points
    -  start with action verbs (developed, created, managed, led, organized, analyzed, designed, implemented, improved, increased, initiated, launched, maintained, planned, produced, reduced, researched, resolved, supervised, trained, wrote)
    -  show numbers, percentages, results: avoid patterns (repeated verbs)
    -  show how used the skills to solve the problems 

##  Dos and Don'ts:
-   try to build own template (full control)
-   margin: 1 inch (four sides): typical
-   font size: 10.5, 12
-   name: only thing larger than font size (2-3 points big)
-   what font to use: arial, calibre, times new roman -> don't distract
-   consistent heading (size, all caps, bold, underline, left aligned)
-   consider using bold and italics, format addresses
-   If shortened (Jan): use in all the places
-   don't make empty claims

##  Objective
-   Clear, concise, specific (keyword optimization): highlight major keys but natural and true
-   eg: 3 years of experience - Business analyst - Using power BI for data visualization
	-  I am business analyst with 3 years of experience. I extensively use power BI for data visualization. I am applying for the job of senior business analyst.

##  Education section
-   college, degree (month), minor: subject/concentration, GPA
-   relevant coursework, skills, projects, internships (in separate sections)

##  Skills:
-   communication, leadership, advocacy
-   ATS/RMS: time management, organization skills, inter discipline team, leadership, advocacy, communication skills, education, critical thinking
-   transferable skills: multitasking, show on time (sounds silly but important), learn new things, leadership
-   show potential(how often, effect, result)
-   situation, task, action, result (STAR): show how used the skills to solve the problems

#   Interview preparation

##  What to do:
-   Convince the interviewer you are the best (use internet profiler)
    -  nextmove.org, buzzfeed.com, dependablestrengths.org
-   won, helped, wrote (action verb): what's the motivation

-   resourceful, decisive, creative, flexible, organized, reliable, persuasive

##  Story building:
-   stories are more memorable than facts (people never forget how you made them feel)
-   inventory of accomplishments
-   who, went, where, why, how: each statement
-   accomplishments from volunteered work, evidence through stories (deepened knowledge, genuine)
-   stories make you unique (why you act, what's wrong, solution, how it worked): keep it up to date

##  good story:
-   very short, opening grabs the attention - relevant, close it (sense of anticipation)
-   be yourself, talk about yourself
    -  how you would do the job, purpose (message of the story), assess what happened
    -  every no is much closer to the yes
-   structure: why this story, give something to remember, never be a one time story
-   talk about characters, dialogue, plot points: what's the lesson
-   who are you, passion, perspective, what you bring if selected.
-   (from work, service, hobbies, internship, classes, projects, team activities): describe task, handling, result and effects: even failed learnt what
-   don't blame: explain where you failed, concise and to the point, how handled conflict at the work

##  Research
-   company, finance, industry, job, interviewer (franklin covey, glass door, LinkedIn)
-   greeting: eye contact

##  Small talk:
-   positive, lasting impact from the very first beginning
-   common ground (converse with strangers)
-   making ownership of your conventional responsibilities - make the interviewer feel good (taking ownership is what matters)
-   connect with the interviewer, observe, listen
-   in the case of panel: make eye contact with everyone
-   simple present tense: express facts, general truth with confidence

##  Tell me about yourself:
-   2 minutes, 3 points: who you are, what you do, what you want to do (200 - 250 words - don't memorize)
-   connect with the job, when you see yourself growing in the new position
-   what you are passionate about, what you are good at, what you are looking for : Be bold
