# Cracking the coding interview

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
-   It's not about solving the existing popular problems, the business is about developing an algorithm and tweak it.
-   Say popular problems with a twist -> so create an algorithm to tackle, explain and discuss with the interviewer -> get assistance -> optimize
-   The interviewer is not looking for the perfect solution, but the thought process and how you approach the problem.
-   Create algorithms, test with different inputs -> optimize -> discuss with the interviewer -> optimize

##  Interview process
-   Algorithms and coding problems form the largest component (problem-solving questions)
-   Interviewer is looking the ability how you're solving the problems you've not seen before (say in 40 minutes)
-   How you're thinking, how you're approaching the problem, how you're communicating, how you're optimizing
-   Sometimes, they may help (normal).
-   Performance:
    -   **Analytical skills:** 
        -   need help to solve, 
        -   how optimal the solution is, 
        -   how long it takes to solve 
        -   if you have to design/architect a new solution: structured? think through the trade-off before taking decisions
    -   **Coding skills:**
        -   translate algorithm into code -> clean, organized, good style, error?
    -   **Technical knowledge:**
        -   strong knowledge in computer fundamentals and relevant technologies
    -   **Experience:**
        -   Any experiences in making decisions (interesting, challenging projects) -  shown drive, initiative, and other important factors
    -   **Culture fit I Communication skills:**
        -    personality and values fit with the company and team   
        -    communicate in the interview well?

##  Why this way?
-   Issues with the process:
    -   Lot of people don't do well
    -   In real world - often lookup the solution if exists (most of the time will exist)
    -   Data structures like binary tree are rarely used in the real world
    -   white board coding - won't happen in real world
-   Why this is the normal practice (tradeoffs):
    -    False negatives are better than false positives (company: ok to miss out good people but not allowing bad people (good at interview but not at job))
    -    Problem solving skill is valuable (developing optimal algorithms)
    -    Smart people tend to do good things that is valuable to the company that matters
    -    Basic DSA knowledge is useful: can't use it if you don't know it (good to know basics)
    -    Whiteboards let you focus on what matters: (pseudocode), people speak more when its whiteboard than on computer
    -    At the end it really depends on the company.
-   How questions are selected:
    -    No syllabus (each interviewer has their own questions) but mostly common / similar pattern
    -    Some companies focus on algorithm (along with system design)
    -    No grading system: its a relative comparison, ask more questions - eliminate luck
    -    It's comparison not b/w candidates this week but all the candidates ever interviewed this question (get a feel)

##  FAQ:
-   No reply (Am I rejected): may be delay, company may not have the policy to inform rejection
    -    No reply (3-5 business days): politely check with the recruiter
-   Re-apply after rejection: usually after 6 months to 1 year (past interviews don't matter)

##  Behind the scenes:
-   One or two screening interview over call (ask the coordinator: position of interviewer,  what the interview
    might cover) - say an engineer will perform a tech interview
    -    Online synchronized editors, paper, home-work -> then email 
-   Onsite: 3 - 6 interviews
    -    1 lunch interview (non-technical): discuss interest, company culture
    -    Other interviews: combination of coding, algorithm, design/architecture, and behavioral/experience questions
    -    After interview: interviewer passes the feedback in some form
    -    Even not heard after a week: follow up with the recruiter (no response means - no update on status not rejection, just be respectful)
-   Microsoft interview:
    -    Microsoft hires geeks, smart people -> prep interview to make you less nervous
    -    recruiter can be your biggest advocate (push re-interview, fight for you to be hired)
    -    2 teams, 4 - 5 interviews in the office (often when passed -> hiring manager will contact), follow up in a week
    -   Questions:
        -    Why want to work here? (purpose: How passion about the technology) 
        -   example: using microsoft code as long as i can remember (VS code -> excellent API, extension: impressed by how manages, delivers)
        -   microsoft gives more control to the teams -> if you reach the hiring manager (positive)
-   Amazon interview:
    -   screening in phone call,
