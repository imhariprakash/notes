# Introduction: Cracking the Coding Interview

## Coding Interviews
(algo, coding, system design)

* Easy question doesn't mean easy: how well you answer than others
* **Problems:** (ability to solve problem - not seen before)
    * Develop an algorithm, optimise it, discuss, get insights and develop
    * Interviews haven't seen the red-black tree since they were in school either
    * Focus on real problems, solutions, patterns - not memorising
* **What to do:**
    * Talk out loud: explain the thought process 
    * Interviewer jump right in and help you
* **Evaluation:**
    * Analytical: how much help needed, how long, design a new solution, structured the problem well, think of trade off
    * Coding skills: translate the algorithm into code - clean, well organised, style, errors (thought about possible errors)
    * Technical knowledge / CS fundamentals
    * Experience: Good decisions, build interesting, challenging projects - drive, initiative and important factors
    * Culture fit / communication skills: personality and values

### Why things are this way
* **Complaints:** tough, not related to the real world, in real world - always can lookup, whiteboard coding - artificial
* False negatives are acceptable (good candidates get rejected)
* Problems solving skills are valuable (decision making, algorithm development): Smart people do great things!
* Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful
    * Meaning you know stuff: You can't use it until you know it exists
    * Hard to ask problem solving questions without them!
* Whiteboard: let you focus on what matters, explain thought process
    * Pseudocode alone not enough, fewer bugs the better!

### Questions
* No restrictions, each team decides their own - but mostly similar - some companies (design, knowledge based)
* Recent interview question: only means asked recently by some interviewer! No other guarantees.
    * Even most questions are similar! (Even across companies)
* No grading system: 
    * assess relative to other candidates (eliminate luck: somebody's bad day!)
    * Not based on standards / question type!
* Didn't hear back: delayed, very few won't respond, 3-5 days: check in politely with the interviewer
* Reapply: wait 6-12 months - mostly

### Interview process
(Some algorithm, some: design)

* **1/2 Screening:** mobile (coding, algo) - ask the position of interviewer (tech/what they cover/ask)
    * May have coding / algorithm.
    * Synchronous online editors / write in papers / homework
* **One on one interview:** 3-6 interviews, ask questions, culture, work
    * Combination of coding, algorithm, design, behaviour, experience
    * After interview: discuss together, recommend to hiring officer / committee
    * No reply: unsure about decisions not rejected!
* **Lunch interview** (among 3-6 interviews):
    * May not submit feedback, ask anything!

#### Microsoft
* Smart people: geeks - write code on the board - will give sample questions
* Recruiter is your biggest advocate - may push re-interview, fight for you
* Why do you want to work for Microsoft:
    * Passionate about tech (using Microsoft as long as I can remember - create a universally excellent product)
    * Specific - I like this - explain a thing about their product (VSCode: APIs are excellent)
* What's unique:
    * Individual control (teams): be unique, think different, explain clearly

#### Amazon
* Phone screen: may ask to write simple code, ask about expertise to ask questions (shared editors)
* Code on white boards, hard interviewer: more power / veto - in making decisions (interviewers may or may not share feedbacks with themselves until submitted their own.)
* Amazon cares a lot about scaling, OOP
* Bar raiser: Hard interviewer from another team with special training - who has significant power.

#### Google
* Google engineer will handle phone interview: expect it to be tough - coding
* Onsite 4-6 interview (including a lunch interview: no feedback - great opportunity - ask questions)
* Feedback categories: analytical, coding, experience and communication (score: 1 to 4)
* Design a scalable system, system design, algorithm skills, analytical skill - algo

#### Apple
* Minimal bureaucracy - excellent tech skills, familiar with the Mac
* Phone call, 6-8 interviews (interviewing teams, member of other teams - close with the team)
* Read the product, apple employees are apple fans - show the same passion
* End of day: interviewers compare notes then interview with VP of the org interviewing

#### Facebook
* 1/2 phone screening: tech/coding - shared doc + homework exercise
* Behavioural (Jedi): culture, values, excited? Challenges? Interest in Facebook
* Coding and algo (ninja)
* Design/architecture (pirate): openly discuss solutions and trade offs
* Show the interest to build stuff fast, hack together - elegant and scalable solution
* What was the hardest bug you faced - show your experience
* 2 ninja, 1 Jedi interviews. Experienced: pirate interview.
* Expectation: entrepreneurial spirit (love to build), hack an elegant and scalable solution.

#### Palantir
* Specific team: 2 phone interviews (tech), optimal solution + correct code
* onsite: domain, DSA, system design
* Demo of palantir products: ask questions, demonstrate passion

## Situations

### Experienced
* DSA might come, Design and architecture - very important 
* Resume - hardest bug ever faced

### Testers and SDETs
* Write code to test features - how to test a bulb, pen, cash register, word
* Coding standards are low but not nil. Write code to do X and now test it.

### Product management
(customer facing, coding)

* Handle ambiguity - don't overwhelmed or stalled - seek new Info, prioritise parts, structured solving
* Customer focus/attitude: how people use: alarm clock for the blind (put on their shoes, understand)
* Customer focus/tech skills: strong product understanding
* Multi level communication: different levels - explain TCP/IP (intern, senior, manager, user, stakeholder)
    * Flexible communication
* Passion for technology: discuss prior experience, why want to work (prior experience, challenges - passion in answer)
* Team work/leadership (disagree with manager - how to handle)

### Dev leads and managers
(coding, algo)

* Teamwork and leadership: lead and work alongside (prior situations: disagree with manager - not arrogant, not passive)
* Prioritisation(how to achieve within deadline - when things are bad, hard - what's critical)
* Communication: above and below (customers, less technical people): friendly and engaging - evaluation of personality
* Getting things done, balance b/w preparing for a project and implementing (prior experience - prepare well)

### Startups
* Personal referral. Most: won't offer visa (reach out via professional)
* Want engineers: smart, code, work in entrepreneurial environment, show initiative, prior projects
* Personality fit: interaction with interviewer (friendly, engaging)
* Skill: hit the ground running
* Resume should show initiative, show you know the company's language

### Acquisitions and acquihires
* Interview: due diligence process (no easy way)
* Engineers, sales, support, PM.

### Mindset
* Take a simple example - develop a solution (easy to find issues, bugs)
* Focus on yourselves: not much boasting but still should, explain your role, details: actions
* First solution doesn't has to be perfect - optimise
* Sanity(competence), quality, specialist(deep knowledge), proxy knowledge (good to know)
* **Questions:**
    * Sanity: easy - won't distinguish okay vs great, just filters worst
    * Quality: more challenging - algo/problem solving is important
    * Specialist: solvable only if has knowledge
    * Proxy knowledge: in depth

## Before the interview

### Right experience
* **Resume** (big project, internship, build something): show initiative
* **Experience** (big coding projects/internship/build something-hackathon/open source): Smart and can code
* Take challenges, tech rich

### Write a great resume
* **Screening:** smart and can code (don't cut tech lines, cut non-tech)
* < 10 years: 1 page, more experienced: 1.5-2 pages (but single page is always good)
* Don't mention full history of employment (relevant positions, impressive): limited content - more attention (likely noticed)
* **Strong bullet points:** (make results measurable)
    * Action - what and how you did it, Result
    * Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z
    * Reduce object rendering time by 75% - implementing distributed cache - leading to a 10% reduction in log in time
    * Increased the average match accuracy by implementing the accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm on Y.

### Projects
* Projects: experience (2-4 significant project) - language, technology
* No need for Details: individual/team - course/independent project (independent - better as shows initiative)

### Programming language/softwares
(what matters to the company and sort based on hard to acquire)

* **Include:** don't list everything - list used, mention proficiency
    * Don't mention years of experience - no use (proficiency: expert, fluent, proficient)
* **Not:** Microsoft word/visual studio code/eclipse

### Language / Non English speakers
* Proofread the resume - some companies throw the resume - typo
* Don't mention age/marital status/nationality (legal liability)

### Stigmas/Myths
* Enterprise language: people think - not sophisticated (VB - unlikely a big company using this)
* If not applying for what skills you have (.Net but diff role)
* Don't be language focused, good programmer won't be language oriented.
* Don't put every certificates
* Very few language or tech - afraid of learning new tech?

### Preparation map
(Use paper instead of IDE often for thinking)

* Learn languages, build projects, network, build portfolio, focus on meaty projects
* Build resume (make target companies), mini projects
* Big O, DSA, mock interviews, rehearse stories from interviews
* Algo approaches
* After interview - write a thank you note to the interviewer.
* Continue practice, what went wrong (list, track progress made on mistakes), resolve and continue applying
* Revisit algo, big O - stories, problems, list of mistakes, progress

## Behavioural questions

### Why
* Know the personality, prior experience, understand the resume, ease your interview

### How to respond

#### Projects (Tech)
Know who is on the other end - if not an expert (key points)

* Refer above: make the grid and revise before interviews. (Keywords: so easy to revise)
* 1/2 projects to discuss about in detail.
* Light details, if asked explain (challenging / Impact / played a central role: specific and open for questions later)
* Eg: I examined the user behaviour - implemented Rabin-karp algorithm - O(n) to O(log n) - in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like
* Must: able to talk: challenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choices of tech, tradeoff - what would you done differently

#### Weakness
(Real weakness: real + emphasise how you work to overcome it)

* Be specific - not arrogant (just facts, describe specific bits - instead I done all this), what was challenging
* **Not:** I work too hard - arrogant, incapable of admitting
* **Yes:** I often don't have good attention in detail (quickly execute - careless mistakes). I ask someone to double check / Spend some time at the end (checklist)

#### To ask the interviewer
(consciously or subconsciously impact their decision)

* **Genuine type:** (day to day life)
    * Ratio of testers to developers to managers (interaction b/w them, project planning)
    * What brought you to this company, what has been most challenging for you
* **Insightful type:** (Tech, advance research)
    * Noticed you are using tech X: how you handle the problem Y (shows knowledge)
    * Using protocol X over Y - I know A, B (benefits), what about C, why not choose protocol Y
* **Passion type:**
    * Interested in scalability, explain opportunities, could you tell me how it works?

#### Focus on yourself not your team
* We/us/team - not matter. What matters is you

### Tell me about yourself/walk through your resume
(pitch, first impression)

#### Chronological
* **Current role** (headline only): SE at microwords - where I've been leading the android team for the last five years
* **College:** background in CS, done my undergrad at XYZ college and spent summers working at startups
* **Post college and onwards:** after college wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations: joined amazon. It was a great experience
    * Learned a lot about large system designs
* **Current role details** (How joined, who influenced, did what): manager recruited me along with him, designed initial system, lead android team.
* **Outside of work:** hackathons, IOS development, moderator in forums.
* **Wrap up:** I'm looking for something new, and your company caught my eye.

### Sprinkle in shows of success
* Drop highlights: recruited by this company (by his old manager) - shows successful at the previous company
* Wanting to be in a smaller environment: culture fit (based on interviewing scenario)
* Success: designed initial pipeline, launch key part, architect - scalable system
* Hobbies: want to learn.
* **Note:**
    * What background, previous tasks, scenarios, company, events: say about you
    * Awards, promotions, recruited by someone, launches.

### Structured answers
(Think of situations and create stories: Nugget and SAR)

#### Nugget first (succinctly describe) and SAR
* **Example:** Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially my school had a rule where…

#### Nugget
Make clear description (give a gist)

#### SAR
Situation, Action, Result (situation and result should be succinct)

* **Situation:** OS project - one team mate stayed quite (more work on us, not sure we can count on him)
* **Action:** Don't want to write him off completely: lazy/busy
    * Conversation: open ended questions (how he felt it was going)
        * He volunteered to do the documentation and write up → he was not lazy but didn't feel like he was good enough to write code
        * I tried to make it clear: he shouldn't fear messing it up, I told him about my mistakes and admitted that I wasn't clear about a lot of parts on the project.
        * Asked to breaking out some of the components and sat down together - once he could see the pieces, he excelled.
* **Result:** Initially excelled some small pieces and later helped with some of the biggest parts.
* **Note:** Situation and result: must be short (interview is about actions you took), break actions into steps: I did this I, II, III

#### Action
Most important: break into multiple parts - I did three things (in this way: deep and clear)

#### What it says
(Think the stories from this perspective)

* Initiative/leadership: address and tackle the situation head on
* Empathy: understand what was happening to others and resolve (team mate's insecurity)
* Compassion: Although the team mate was hurting the team, not angry - empathy lead to compassion
* Humility: admit flaws (not only to the teammate but to the interviewer)
* Team work/helpfulness
    * Eg: I made sure to call the client myself, because I knew that he would appreciate hearing it directly from me.

### Common questions
(read, make stories)

* **Project:** challenges, mistakes/failures, enjoyed, leadership, conflicts, what you'd differently
* Speak technical depth of each projects
* **Hobbies:** (demonstrate personality attributes)
    * You should discuss - hence caution before mentioning.
    * Not extreme, common (skip).
    * Technical: good to mention (passion), remodelling house (initiative)
* **What are your weaknesses:**
    * Not I'm arrogant, foolish - not to admit faults
    * Real, legitimate weakness: emphasize how you work to overcome it
    * Eg: sometimes, I don't have good attention in detail: while that's good - execute quickly - but careless mistakes
        * So I will make someone double check my work
* **What to ask the interviewer:**
    * Genuine questions, 
        * Ratio of testers to developers, interaction b/w them, project planning
        * What brought you to this company, what's the challenge
    * insightful question
        * You use tech X - how you have handled the problem of issue D
        * You use protocol A over B - why (it has benefits like A, B but how you overcome: issue D)
    * passion questions
        * I'm very interested in scalability - love to learn more about it. What opportunities- there
        * I'm interested about tech X - could you tell me more about it
* **Know your tech projects:**
    * Deeply master: challenging components, played a central role, technical depth
    * challenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choices of technologies, things you would so differently, scaling

## Questions

### Insightful

#### Mysql
* How you have handled - In and Not In - when used for a nullable column or null in list → as null is considered as unknown
