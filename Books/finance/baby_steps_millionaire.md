## **Chapter 5:**
-   **Belief versus barriers:**
    -   Don't quit before you start!
    -   Unbelief:
        -   “I can’t do this. 
		-	The deck is stacked against me. 
		-	I have nothing, not even my parents. 
		-	I can’t afford rent, let alone college. 
		-	It’s too much. There’s no reason to even try. 
		-	What would Jackie’s life have looked like if she didn’t think she stood a chance? 
        -   What choices would she have made? 
        -   Is it likely she would be a millionaire today?”
    -   **Belief matters , hope matters a lot**
    -   wake up from the victim mentality
    -   It's not about career or titles or how much money you make but belief and baby steps (action)
        -   Immigrants are more successful than natives - even they tend to start from far.
        -   took chance, believed, worked, sacrificed, and succeeded
        -   It's not where you come from, it's where you're going, it's about the response not about the situation.
        -   > “The minute you think of yourself as a victim, you’ve given control of your life to somebody else. And you might not be able to control your circumstances, but you can control your response to your circumstances, so don’t you ever think of yourself as a victim.”
        -   > You have what you want! Bust the barriers. play your hand, don't fixate on the obstacles
    -   > Do not be deceived. Bad company ruins good morals. Don't normalize!
    -   > Being poor is a state of mind, being broke is a temporary situation.
  
## **Chapter 6:**
-   hard part is not earn it but to keep it
-   fast money, no character - destroys the person
-   The race is not always to the swift
-   can't regain what's lost, focus what's in front, manageable steps over the long haul
-   > Patience is a competitive advantage.

## **Chapter 7:**
-   Will wealth ruin my kids:
    -   money itself is neutral and amoral (neither good / bad), behavior is the key
    -   develop money-smart children (work, give, save, spend, steward)
    -   five behaviors: work, give, save, spend, steward
    -   **work:**
        -   work and save for it instead of taking a loan
        -   money come from work not monthly allowances (without work ethic, chores, effort)
        -   make to feel proud not entitled (commission not allowances), give dignity
        -   check boxes/chart - strategize goals
        -   balance between doing work for commission and family
    -   **Give:**
        -   clenched fist, stagnant pond - nothing flows out
        -   be open hearted, generous, giving leaves no room for selfishness
    -   **Save:**
        -   plan before spend, save : not impulsive
    -   **Steward:**
        -   you own nothing, just managing - avoid self centered attitude

    -   equal is unfair (effort, talent, intelligence)

    -   security, generosity

## **Chapter 9:**
-   hope is a mighty force - changes attitude, creates opportunities
