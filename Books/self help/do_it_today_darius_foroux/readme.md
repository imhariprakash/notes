# Do it today

----------------------------------------------------------------
# Part I - Mindset

----------------------------------------------------------------

-   Living life on autopilot: But I'm in charge of my life
-   control time, action and attention
-   get a lot of work done and be happy at the same time, Do it today
>   Do the important things today - read, exercise, laugh, spend time with the ones I love
-   Life doesn't stop, if doesn't go the way - start doing the next one
-   figure out what's important and do it today eliminate the rest
-   negativity has more impact than positivity
>   cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today

##  Plan
-   Mindset
-   Map
-   Stay on the path

##  Do it today, don't wait for tomorrow
-   Reason: everytime skipping, blaming others (do the hard way - not think a way to evade)
-   framework:
    -  exercise mind, 
    -  body, 
    -  daily habits, 
    -  list of tasks, 
    -  science of persuasion

##  What to do if I can't focus:
-   distractions: call, meeting, person, cat, false emergency
-   things won't disturb you until you allow
-   eliminate. eliminate. eliminate.
    -  accumulate positive, negative thoughts, habits
    -  eliminate ideas, projects, work, object -> filter out and eliminate -> make it simple

##  Think about past success:
-   Serotonin: simulate happiness, reduce depression, control sleep cycle, anxiety, delayed gratification
-   Not normal to check phone everytime, gossip, bored

##  Beat procrastination:
-   know harmful but still doing it (feel better in short term but suffer in long term)
-   cost: depression, irrational beliefs, low self-esteem, stress and anxiety
-   result of poor self-regulation: enjoy until deadline pressure then sudden stress
>   This is the last time I'm wasting my time. Will power doesn't work but system does
```chatinput
    -   Self imposed deadlines
    -   Accountability (coach, commitment)
    -   working in intervals
    -   exercise, eat healthy
    -   eliminate distractions
    -   internal motivation
```

##  stop wasting time: improve efficiency:
-   80/20 rule: 80% of the results come from 20% of the work
-   productive and happy - advance faster, learn more (do what matters the most or meaningful or useful)
>   Result is what matters
```chatinput
    -   Know thy time (measure time and have an activity log for atleast 2 - 4 weeks)
    -   identify non-productive work
    -   eliminate time wasters
```

##  Habits of unproductive people:
```chatinput
    -   working too much - in terms of time (not for long term)
    -   worry too much (be grateful)
    -   being stubborn
    -   checking things unnecessarily (phone, email)
    -   escaping life (drink, vacation, skip present)
    -   saying yes (say no to a million things, yes to a few)
    -   not writing things down (use brain for solving)
    -   being hard on themselves (be proud of yourself instead)
    -   neglecting personal education (learning never ends)
    -   hating rules (freedom and constraint - right level)
    
    good thing is you make up the rules
```

##  30 minute ritual:
```chatinput
    -   0 - 10 minutes: close the day, review progress, remember things
    -   11 - 20 minutes: plan tomorrow (meeting, deadline)
    -   21 - 25 minutes: plan outfits
    -   26 - 30 minutes: visualize the day
```

##  Disconnect from the internet
>   To be everywhere is to be nowhere
-   Distraction: reason for stress, frustration
-   Too much is also not good (over-train, smoother people, burnout, fat)
-   Turnoff wifi/internet -> only enable when needed (choose when to use)

##  Reason for procrastination:
-   Do stuff that matters - won't delay (am I passionate? am I doing meaningful work?)
-   Have a mantra: Let's do it, say it everytime
-   manage action not time (time can't be managed). 
-   Don't be held captive by others (not disturbed for 10 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------------------

#   Part II - Improving productivity

----------------------------------------------------------------
##  Smart-phone behaviour
-   Turn off notifications, always distant mobile phones
-   remove apps, control how you operate
>   I love my phone but I don't need it

##  Perfectionism (destroyer of productivity):
-   mistakes are part of life (admit it, learn from it)
-   not right moment, 24 hours are enough (never starts, high standards: not good)
-   only tasks pileup, more worries
```chatinput
    -   Set a deadline (Learn to be resourceful)
    -   Do it now (regressive and recursive self regulation)
    -   Do it today
    -   Do it imperfectly (find balance)
    -   Do it with mistakes
    -   Do it with joy
```
-   Have a balance b/w perfectionist and a slacker (i don't care mindset)
-   rely on systems not habits

##  How to read 100 books a year:
-   read more, buy more, have an inventory
-   always be reading (train, eat, out)
-   read relevant books, no orders, may skip, may read multiple
-   retain knowledge - take notes (even never going to use)

##  vacation and productivity:
-   Take a time off (improves productivity) - not because of vacation but idle time
-   rest reduces stress, increases productivity
-   less time - less procrastination - more productivity
-   plan itenaries, make daily movies (record - dairy), read a lot, get bored (find new ideas, rest, take it easy)

##  Eliminate mindless browsing:
-   interruptions and multitasking - not good (juggling is not good)
-   do what's worth the time

##  20 things for productivity:
```chatinput
    1. cut the chase (chat, talk, wait: useless)
    2. record thoughts (log, diary, notes)
    3. say no
    4. 5 min break every 45 min (pomodoro)
    5. eliminate distractions
    6. keep away the clutter
    7. focus on 1 thing
    8. stop consuming so much
    9. create routines
    10. no multitasking
    11. check email only twice
    12. no smartphone during 1st hour
    13. plan the next day
    14. keep thinking to a minimum, do the thing
    15. exercise
    16. laugh
    17. Don't go to meetings
    18. Is that really necessary
    19. reset: meditate, music when its a bad day
    20. do the work, do it today
```

##  Time off improves work and life
-   idle time heps (collect things, good for long term), prevent rather than cure
-   check whether did the right things (execution, thinking)
-   inner conversations - process ideas (plan, visualize): instead of wasting time (plan before doing)
-   consume more art
-   focus on other important things other than work
-   resting gets boring, quick - after rest - work comes

##  Time blocking
-   block the time for one thing and do it anyway
-   awareness tool (calendar): don't over schedule, realistic, allocate more time than needed
-   key is steady work everyday
-   plan should be precise (10k steps, 15 push-ups)
-   pomodoro: 5min break every 45 min (reduce distraction - enjoy the reward: walk, stretch, coffee)

----------------------------------------------------------------

#  Part III - Achieve more

----------------------------------------------------------------
>   Man chasing two rabbits at a time won't catch either
-   Accept the uncertainty (we don't have answers to everything: just start)
-   know the direction not the destination
-   work on universal skills 
    - self-discipline, 
    - personal effectiveness, 
    - communication, 
    - effectiveness, 
    - negotiation, 
    - persuasion,
    - stamina, flexibility

##  Leave the office on time (leave the work at work)
-   work expands to fill the time available (result counts not long hours)
-   don't feel bad or unfair to leave when work is done
-   working too long -> unproductive 
    -  leave on time
    -  if you can't do it in 6-8 hours - not effective
    -  leave work at work

##  Consistency:
-   do the work everyday (even if it's small), 0.1% improvement everyday
-   control desire, attitude, judgements, determination: what one can control instead of worrying
-   make a mistake, correct, find solution (accept)
-   inconsistency: enemy of progress / result
-   comfort zone: not entirely required to be outside (just make sure to take changes, expand)
-   don't pretend what you are not (work road to magic: sweat, tears, blood)

##  Believe to achieve:
>   Beliefs will help to create facts - shape reality
>   Don't compete, create (abundant mindset)
>   Fear begets fear - thing you can't -> you won't
-   keep it real, put effort, take action (can't find a right career -> create one)
-   don't wait for the right moment, create it (don't listen to naysayers)

##  Strength from repeating:
-   don't ignore basics / foundation, everything starts with the mind (stay as a beginner)
-   without repetition, no progress, brain forgets
-   measure life:
    -  energy (good mood-> good work-> good relationships): exercise and eat good
    -  work (how much you learn)
    -  relationship (only stick to yourself - what I'm offering)
-   Live like an immortal:
    -  build meaningful career, contribute to others
    -  help others (directly or indirectly): invest
>   When I know I have all the time - slow down - but don't procrastinate
-   Be present (don't overdo, think future too)
-   All the time in world (do mistakes, no pressure, treat people with respect)
-   Have a sense of urgency, short term + long term view
