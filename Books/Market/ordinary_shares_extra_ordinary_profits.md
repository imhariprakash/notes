# Ordinary shares extraordinary profits
    
## prologue:
-  The main ingredients of a strong portfolio: are discipline and liquidity
-  accumulate a small amount of stocks with a long-term story intact
-  debt and leverage could kill a company and destroy value

       -  debit the reserve and credit the same in equity
         -  result: issuance of fresh shares
         -  new shares flow: may decrease the price in short term
         -  long term: go back to normal and rewarding
    -  **rights issue**:
         -  raise money to fund project / acquire company
         -  issue new shares to existing customers at a discounted price
         -  rights issue can also be issued as convertible bonds: draws fixed interest for a period and converted to shares at pre determined price and ratio
    -  **convertible bonds:**
        -   other way to raise money 
            -   foreign currency convertible bonds 
                -   overseas company issues to FII (underlying security: stock)

    -   **share split:**
        -   reduce face value - when unit price is very high
        -   number of shares increases, theory: value unchanged (1 share = 100, 10 shares will be 100)
    -   **dividend :** distribute to share holders (taxed at source) - interim dividend (when great profits)
    -   **long term:**

        -   when market 20% drop - best time to invest
        -   market doesn't matter - individual stocks do
    -   **theory:**
        -   when no body talks about stocks: stage 1
        -   tell how risky: stage 2
        -   people ask which stocks to buy: stage 3
        -   advices: stage 4

## chapter 2: business cycles:
-   **government:**
    -   **reforms**: free economy from closed one
    -   **closed economy**: govt controls everything (no private property) - black market trades, poverty
    -   **public sector**: usually no ownership or accountability
-   **effect of interest rate on economy and stocks:**
    -   government decides fiscal policy (expenditure (departments) and income (direct and indirect tax) figures)
    -   **RBI decides monetary policy**
        -   rupee not highly available: value increases (so keep supplies constant) - stable inflation
    -   **instruments to control money available**:
        -   credit : RBI lend money as last resort to institutions (flow increases)
        -   money supply (raise cash reserve ratio (deposit retain), SLR (set aside for govt bond purchase), auctions - to introduce or suck out money)
        -   interest rates (REPO, reverse REPO)
            -   REPO: banks borrow from RBI
            -   reverse REPO: bank lends to RBI
            -   when money is cheap : more credit used
        -   **Aggregate demand** = consumption by households + investment (business spending on capital goods) + government spending + net exports 
        -   **fiscal policy:**
            -   **direct tax:** personal and corporate
            -   **indirect tax:** production, import, export, LTCG
            -   diff b/w income and revenue: fiscal deficit / surplus
                -   deficit: higher borrowing by government - high inflation - higher interest rates
                -   high interest rate: less consumption and growth slowdown (further increase fiscal deficit as growth slowdown income slowdown)
            -   **fiscal deficit / trade gap** = savings - investment = import - export
            -   trade gap (fiscal deficit) -> covered by borrowing capital from overseas
            -   high borrowing -> damages current account figures, weak domestic currency (costlier imports)
            -   same time: focus on growth and stimulating economy
            -   interest rate - reflection of cost of money in an economy
            -   real interest rate = bank rate - inflation
    -   Effects of fiscal deficit:
        -   **Deficit and Inflation:**
            -   when the government is spending more than the revenue from tax collection, borrows money (issue bonds, print money in extreme cases)
            -   borrow money - injects more liquidity into the economy, boost demand (when demand outpaces supply - inflation)
            -   increased borrowing can drive up the interest rates (discourage private investments - not an issue if workers available)
        -   **Surplus and inflation:**
            -   more revenue than spending - excess cash (pay debts, save)
            -   less spending means, less liquidity, lower demand (low inflation, lower interest rate)
        -   **Economic Recession:**
            -   Not same as above two (labor, resources) - underutilized, hence inflation is reduced
    -   **Gold:**
        -   when interest rate is low / negative: money move from banks to other asset classes
        -   when interest rate is negative -> gold value increases -> currency value depreciates in terms of gold
        -   india - largest consumer (25 tonnes to 30 tonnes reserve) - hedge against inflation
    -   **Inflation:**
        -   when excess money chases goods
        -   any one having hard asset (cash, deposits): affected - poor are affected more
    -   **Interest rate and stock market:**
        -   increase in interest rate -> increases cost of borrowings, decreases profit (sales are affected, price increase)
        -   sectors affected mainly: auto, real estate, consumers good, banks
        -   slow down economy, increase unemployment
        -   suck out money -> inflation decreases -> money value increases 
        -   increase in interest rate: temporary fall in market (panic) -> good time to buy
    -   **Effect of inflation on stocks:**
        -   1971 -> Nixion took USA from gold standard -> print any amount of money
        -   central banks -> intervene to avoid recession -> cut rates (even down to 0%)
        -   **asset of company:** valued on paper currency -> decreased interest rate -> appreciation of stocks (peak market)
        -   at the time of raising interest rate -> markets will be at all time high -> bear market
        -   Boom - Burst sequence: period of boom is longer than burst 
        -   why: fall quickly, forcibly liquidated (at long terms -> smooth)
        -   identify correct stocks (quantitative and qualitative methods)
        -   best time to buy: market is in panic, exit: when highly over valued
    -   **deep correction:**
        -   recession: two quarters of negative growth in GDP
        -   ease interest rate, increase money supply, reduce tax, borrow money to stimulate economy
        -   recession: buy good stocks at bargain

## chapter 3: equities:
-   **bonds and FD:** when adjusted to inflation: returns are negative (especially India)
    -   tolerance level inflation (India) : 5%
    -   most private sectors - no pension schemes, PF: returns also negligible
    -   equities: hedge against inflation, no time / knowledge: passive ETF
    -   **lose money:**
        -   buy a great company at overvalued price (irrational bull market) - wait for years
        -   buy a lousy company at any price - lose money
    -   **consider while investing:**
        -   nature of business and quality of management
        -   correct price?
    -   **MOAT:**
        -   bug ditch surrounding a fort (10 feet deep and wide), draw bridge to enter the fort
        -   company have moats - inherent advantage - doesn't allow others to enter their market 
        -   acquire moat companies cheap and hold in boom years
        -   **types of moat:**
            -   moat by government regulation and taxation
                -   tobacco: ad, brand promotion restricted, taxation high
                -   little chance for new brand emerging, foreign investment banned
                -   MNC can't enter and spend money in marketing and distribution
                -   existing players dominate and profit (ITC)
            -   **first mover advantage and use of networks:**
                -   entrenched player - difficult to get customers from them (Sun tv) - control both content and distribution
                -   Advertisements flock to them - positive feedback loop
                -   no revenue (no body gives ad to a new player) - no content - no TRP -> negative feedback loop
                -   banking: SBI, LIC (all govt maintains their account with them)
            -   **low cost moat:**
                -   lowest cost producers - easy access to raw materials (advantage than JSW and hindustan zinc)
            -   **regulated market:**
                -   licensing policies of local government (state transport authority)
                -   eg: three wheeler vehicle market - bajaj, tvs 
            -   **building a moat by opening new product category:**
                -   eg: large gap between 3 wheelers and light weight commercial vehicles
                    -   tata motors: Ace - sold 5L units even before competitor launch a product
                    -   apple: regular launches - 3 trillion dollar company
                    -   gillete: innovative product - create a moat - hard for competitors to penetrate
                -   investor - able to identify - great, when market realizes the moat: share price plummets
    -   **fischer's test:**
        -   identify good company at a good price
        -   **fischer's 15 rules:**
            1. Products steadily increase sales over several years
            2. Will management invest in new product development when existing product's sales taper
            3. How are the company's sales organized
            4. How effective is company's R&D in relation to its size
            5. What is the margin of profit
            6. Will profit margin improve
            7. How company treat its labour and personnel
            8. How company treat its executives
            9. Depth of management in the company
            10. Financial controls of the company
            11. Any aspects peculiar to this industry that offers a clue to the investor about any outstanding features of the company
            12. Is the company outlook for profits short term or long term
            13. Will the company be forced to issue new equity to finance future growth
            14. Is the management open about its problem to the investors
            15. Does the owner have outstanding integrity
        1.  **Increase in sales for several years:**
            *   lesson: right time, right place -> set up -> expand -> diverge -> grow over years
            *   most experts worries about short term (quarter to quarter results / year to year) - quick profit
            *   some incident - boosts growth when stagnates - growth slows down - company disappear
            *   sterilite - largest player in non ferrous metals bought 2 government company + captive mines (hindustan zinc, bharat aluminum company)
            -   sell excess power from power plant - in scarcity situation, setting up green field power plants
            -   things gone right:
                *   anticipation of bubble
                *   captive mines - cheap - made super profits
            -   similarly hindalco and ambuja cements
            -   Right time at right place - As country grows, company too
            -   M&M: tractor, expanded to vehicle then others like real estate...
        2.  **Management invest in new product as existing one's sales diminish:**
            *  new centers, products, services - portfolio
            *  ITC: aware (tobacco - high vat and restrictions - not a future market)
            *  ITC: farmers(adopt new tech - raw materials), encourage growing forest (paper business and agro business), untapped markets: notebook, newer products continuously
            *  bajaj: 3 wheeler passenger vehicle, geared scooters
            -   honda gearless scooter - became favorite among men and women
            -   tied up with kawasaki and competed tvs and hero
                -   interest free loans, R&D -> boxer, pulsar -> dominated 125cc bikes -> second leader in south east asia
        3. **How are the sales of a company organized:**
           - **math ratios:** production cost, R&D
           -   important: how sales department is organized (no sales no revenue)
            -   no analyst discuss this or ad and marketing strategies and effect of products in market
           -   training sales personnel, distribution chain spending - must
           -   sales potential analysis (investor must do): customer and competitor talks about this
           -   testament, re-orders - sales pattern
           -   HUL: 
                -   makes trainee spend time in remote / local distribution centers - sales route, product study
                -   training: ensure company growth
                -   more money spent on training sales personnel -> more successful it will be
        4. **R&D effectiveness:**
           -   publicly listed: easy to know about R&D
           -   research must be done in good and bad years
                -   sometimes no fruitful return (drug companies - most of them never jump trial)
                -   some cases: outstanding product - eg: Tata ACE
            -   India: produce drugs with patents - free (Dr Reddy)
                -   good R&D, many drug applications, drug master files
                -   sun pharma and bicon - heavy R&D
        5. **margin of profit for a company:**
           -   two types of companies:
                -   lower profit margins during normal years 
                -   higher profit margins during normal years
           -   investor - confirm spent into R&D / sales promotion or new product development (profit margin decreases)
            -   tata motors: 500 crores loss in 2003 (ACE, jaguar, land rover acquisition)
           -   no investment (high sales) -> no future growth -> company with moderate profit margin
        6. **will company's profit margin improve:**
           -   difficult to maintain profit margin among global volatility
           -   some companies -> increase cost (pass the burden to cx), less lucky companies: innovate to reduce costs
           -   plan long term to avoid disruption of business and cost control
                -   teams to reorganize existing process, products, plants, machinery, optimize, transport, logistics, power cost
                -   eg: JSW need to import ore (karnataka - banned mining of iron)
        7. **company treats its labour and personnel:**
           -   least appreciated facets by investors
           -   frequent strikes, inability to retain talents (additional training cost, non loyal employees) - business loss
           -   attitude of management to the rank and employees (avoid companies with no feeling on employees)
        8. **How company treat its executives:**
           -   executive: manage team, execute project
           -   how much confidence the executives have in the board / chairman (upon promotion, salary rise, fair, transparent : satisfied)
           -   when management role - filled from outside rather than internal promotions (bell should ring) - not healthy
                -   executives are the one who make / break the plan of top management
        9. **Depth of management of the company:**
           -   management talent to replace - grow continuously from with in
           -   TCS:
                -   JRD Tata - from tata power FC kholi + talented engineers = TCS (no background)
                -   TCS revenue - helped other Tata companies : Tata sons (crown jewel)
           -   All CEOs have come up internally through the system
        10. **Financial controls of the company:**
            -   accounting guidelines implemented?
            -   record even smallest details - cost, allocation proportion among divisions
            -   if not recorded: unable to asses which department contribute to the bottom line (sales promotion on wrong products)
            -   extreme cases: fictitious financial statements, inflating expenses (personal expenses charged to the company)
            -   hard for an investor to detect this (pickup signals from promoter) - 
                * satyam (promoter bought a website for 500cr)
                * group company is sold to outside investors
                * intangible asset - this is too much  
                  -   vijay mallaya:
                      -   promoter running cricket, formula 1 while airline canceling scheduled flights - can't pay fuel bills
                      -   more debt to pay debt, debt is converted to equity forcibly
                      -   moat is strong in the core business - but pledged for his lifestyle 
                      -   done the same thing - sold father's paint business, FMCG brand
                -   read promoter's history
        11. **Aspects peculiar to this industry that offers clue to the investor about any outstanding features of the company:**
            -   certain business requires skills (retail - managing real estate)
            -   consumer goods: Advertisements (media skill set): ability to do cost benefit analysis
            -   proper enquiry and research can tell us - whether a company spent more money for reaching the same larger audience than competitor
            -   skill: low cost Advertisements - cost cutting measure (HUL, Godrej, Cadbury). (Bata - failed)
            -   credit handling (finance) - non performing asset can make or break a company
            -   financing projects - can give favorable edge in long term
            -   A highly skilled treasury team - reduce the need for borrowing or necessity to dilute equity for new green field projects
        12. **Is the company outlook short term or long term:**
            -   **professional managers**: short term
            -   **situation**: news channels - comparing quarterly profits, predicting future - Even though it matters only a couple of days
            -   investor must look at a stock in point of view refused by management to talk
                -   tata motors, M&M, bajaj out performed maruti for 10 years 
                    -   reason: royalty paid to the MNC instead of investing
                -   **Media pressure:**
                    -   look for short term profit, sacrificing long term
                    -   give stock options for the employees 
                    -   when stock price falls, no body wants equity (FCCB)
                        -   want to repay with interest, company under pressure
                        -   sell asset for cash flow - sacrifice long term growth
                    -   No expert takes more than a year's view of the stock performance (most less than 6 months)
                -   **media revenue:** from trend advertisement, playing with the instinct of a gullible trader
                    -   investor must focus on long term viewed companies (big trends change the way we live - missed by newspaper and TV)
                    -   how to find out when media misses:
                        -   whether company investing in long term
                        -   how company treats is vendors and customers
                            -   willing to compensate a vendor for unexpected increase in cost - or squeeze to the last rupee
                            -   when tables turn: vendor will favor
            -   **customer treatment :**
                -   product recalls, service issues - as cost of acquiring a new customer will be more than repairing
                -   eg: Dish TV (arrogant behavior of promoter and employees) - lost market share and customers
                -   worry about decades not quarters
        13. **Will the company be forced to issue new equity to finance future growth:**
            -   when forced: when no one willing to give debt
            -   when unable to acquire debt at cheap rates, other options: dilute equity
            -   any dilution in equity means:
                -   profit per share is going to drop in the immediate future (share price may not increase)
            -   If capital requirement funded by combination of borrowings and internal accrual 
            -   no need to worry, profits upcoming will fix the share price
        14. **Is management open about its problem to its investors:**
            -   events, profit reduction, sales stagnation, product recall
                -   even out of best R&D happens - overshoot the budget
            -   how management handles this: communicate?
                -   investor can get valuable info on attitude 
                -   denies reality - inability of management to handle crisis and panics
                -   solution: accept and rectify (reduce long term damage)
            -   avoid companies - management is ignorant (not transparent)
                -   intel: how handled floating point error in intel pentium processor
                -   who affected: scientists doing math calculations after the tenth decimal
                    -   big hue and cry even though management's explanation
                    -   offered free replacement - crisis disappeared
                    -   buying shares at this period - would be great
                -   **American express bank: **
                    -   wrong certifying warehouse (oil but had water) by subsidiary
                    -   buffet found - this scam doesn't affected core business - bought 5% shares (35% of funds) - sold 5 1/2 times profit in 5 years 
                    -   If a great company falters(not ignorant): you may get a bargain
        15. **Owner integrity:**
            -   close to assets of a company: promoter and top management
            -   may exploit illegally or legally - morally corrupt
                -   employ relatives / friends at high salary
                -   lease own land at higher rent
                -   insider purchase - route all raw material purchase through a company owned by insider
                -   legal method: shell company (promoter has shares - face value low / zero / free shares / stock options) - listed parent company funds the shell company with advances
                    -   once profitable - sold to parent company at huge premium
                -   promoter enjoys risk free huge return with zero investment
            -   promoter takes lions share - reward themselves of net profit (salary or commission)
            -   best company:
                -   management and promoters with trusteeship and morality to all stake holders (minority too)
                -   don't invest in a company where promoters abuse trust
                -   promoter's share is less than 26% : risk (best avoid)
    -   **value stocks:**
        -   P/E ratio is very low compared to index figures - can borrow at lower rates (easy to expand)
        -   with interest rate cuts - outperform the market
        -   rights issue:
            -   value stocks usually issues fresh shares in the form of rights issue (discounted price)
        -   repay debt from accruals, fund expansion using cash flow - enhances their borrowing power
        -   value stock: dalal street not yet recognized this - so dirt cheap
        -   EPS grow steadily, next boom - grow steadily
        -   eg: tata motors 
            -   2001: 500cr loss - but next year became profitable - regular dividends
            -   2008: bought land rover and jaguar - stock punished (147)
            -   10 face value -> split 2 face value
            -   2011 -> EPS became 155 (adjusted to stock split = 31)
            -   180 in Nov 2011 (PE < 6), jaguar and LR sales increased
            -   great earnings but dalal street - out of favour
            -   inflation dropped -> interest rate decreased -> total dividend payout alone 108.70 (8 yrs)
        -   time passes -> good value company becomes good growth company -> outstanding returns (eg: titan)
        -   titan:
            -   watch manufacturer (first : quartz watches in India - Joint venture TIDCO)
            -   (high debt -> price = 39) new management -> dropped joint venture -> Tanishq was strengthened
            -   sonata, tata gold, higher end watches, titan eye plus, fast track (100 times returns)
            -   cigarettes yet to be lit but thrown to the floor
    -   growth stock:
        -   very high P/E : opposite of value stock
        -   Earnings per share will be low -> when growth requires money -> they issue new equity 
        -   even can borrow -> they prefer equity (cheaper)
        -   banks won't pity -> as profit may shrink
        -   can issue stocks, earnings yield 2%, post tax returns 8-9%
        -   dalal street's favorite, so costly
        -   best growth companies: won't issue stocks -> managed by cash flow (ITC)
            -   cigarettes, paper, hotels, oil
            -   board room struggle -> BAT tried increasing its share -> with DII survived
                -   merged paper and hotel : with parent
                -   farmers: advice on tech and seeds, fertilizer -> grown into FMCG
                -   biscuit, chips, noodles, paper, packing, stationery, agarbattis
                -   moat: hotels and FMCG
            -   L&T:
                -   construction, power, shipbuilding, IT, finance, insurance, defense
                -   ambani tried to take over, only got a seat (exited cement business)
            -   Dr reddy:
                -   founding time: India had process patent (can copy but with a different process)
                -   when product patent came: it had capabilities to develop own molecules (ANDA, DMF)
                -   became leader, MNC, several acquisition, mastered complicated processes and techniques (bio similar - hard to copy)
                -   Unlike ranbaxy - seller didn't wanted to sell the company
    -   turn around stocks:
        -   sick: loan, non profitable, no new products (sell off in market) - distressed price - buying opportunity
        -   factors:
            -   brand value, 
            -   products have market or future
            -   still make money if problem solved
            -   current management is capable
            -   does management recognize and sell the company for stock holders return 
        1. brand value:
            -   titan: watch making company -> jewelry
            -   huge debts, losses
            -   new management -> 18 carat to 22 carat jewelry, franchise route to sell, karat meter -> purity (customers are attracted)
        2. future:
            -   great companies survive and reinvent
            -   Intel: manufacture core memory for IBM -> better and lost cost processors 
                -   80% of revenue from IBM -> bold move shifting to processors (micro processors)
                -   IBM personal computer became standards but Intel developed better 
                -   kill yourself before competitors do and improve
            -   bajaj:
                -   gearless variety dominated, tied up with kawasaki, dominating 3 wheeler market
                -   bright spot: debt free
                -   invented: pulsar, boxer -> dominated 125 and 150cc segment
                -   it exited scooter segment -> gearless and geared bikes
                -   de merger: holding company, finance, auto
        3. still make money:
            -   promoter mismanagement - cook books -> one day unable to manage 
            -   new management took off
        4. management's capability:
            -   turn around? Ford: almost in bankruptcy
            -   henry ford's grandson -> fired top management -> pledged everything, sold subsidiaries, outsourced jobs
            -   made profitable, survived credit crises
            -   M&M:
                -   tractor -> loss making -> cars, SUVs, heavy vehicles, fiance company
        5. management ready to sell for stock holders:
            -   no equity to run -> merge with bigger one 
                -   centurion bank (NBFC -> bank), new promoter came in and merged with punjab bank
                -   opportunity came: merged with HDFC
    -   momentum stocks:
        -   no fundamentals (TV, AD): move up or down - day trader's favorite
        -   analyst come up with explanation after everything over 
        -   directions: unpredictable, wild horses
        -   no one can do money on sustained basis (brokerage, taxes - wiped out in no time)
        -   types:
            -   unusual movement in trade hours   
                -   novice trader jumps in - no idea why happening
                -   usually newly listed, promoter wants to sell (stock manipulation)
            -   momentum trading:
                -   government sectors: power, energy, fertilizer - possible action
                -   when occurs: increase, else: decrease (political), sugar 
            -   news flow:
                -   positive or negative
        -   instances:
            -   satyam: fraud news -> crashed from 500 to 6
            -   suzlon: takeover by debt -> recession 
            -   SKS micro finance: IPO with hype and celebrity, bitter reorganization -> mighty fall 
            -   king fisher airlines: reckless borrowing -> bankrupt

## chapter 4: Fundamental analysis:
-   Intro:
    -   use quantitative method and ratios - from reports
    -   data -> to decide from public reports and data (judge safety, returns)
    -   factors: 
        -   **inflation:**
            -   older days gold currency standard - stable inflation and followed by deflation 
            -   now: nowhere except japan - deflation there
            -   asset depreciates fast - not good for middle class, debt increases (people cut consumption, purchase of assets, hold money) - deflation
            -   central bank - allowed low level of inflation and doesn't avoided deflation
            -   real estate, banks, automobiles : sensitive to interest rates (affects margins)
            -   less debt means good, higher level of borrowing ability
        -   **interest rates:**
            -   high inflation is followed by high interest rates - declining profit, low sales - economic slowdown
            -   look forward, have idea about interest rates - how affects a stock
            -   how stock reacts to business cycles
            -   ability to perform: than competitors with high brands - in adverse market conditions / poor management
            -   enough strength in balance sheet to withstand high interest period (pessimism - may extend for a long time) - eg: TATA
        -   **economic policy and regulatory environment:**
            -   general economic indicators, budget: tax collection and spending (infra)
            -   ability to buy fuel of India : affects subsidy bills (oil marketing companies: Government is the judge, jury and the prosecutor - best avoid)
            -   eg sectors: electricity, fertilizer, sugar - input and output are govt controlled
            -   be careful when jumping into a regulated sector
        -   **risk of currency fluctuations and effect on company:**
            -   US dollar - no longer gold standard
            -   To make exports competitive - East asian countries maintained currency value < US Dollar
            -   They bought dollars, maintained local currency appreciation (artificial manipulation)
            -   India never had consistent current account surplus (energy and gold imports together accounted for > 60% of import)
            -   thirst for gold:
                -   Indian rupee depreciated against basket of international currencies
                -   diversified export: software, pharma, HR (skill, unskilled) - largest inward remittance
                -   In India (flow of capital is controlled and restricted - value of rupee - huge impact on company)
                    -   say import company (local income) - when currency weakens : import cost increases
        -   **cost of raw material, capital:**
            -   India: net importer of commodities (rupee depreciating - not a good news)
            -   eg: JSW, tata power, adani power
            -   foreign currency debt - cheap when rupee is valued - higher depreciation can wipe out company
            -   repayment may not be due - but devaluation cost - loss
            -   must have a hedge to tackle
    
-   **limits of fundamental analysis:**
    -   analysis: careful consideration (buy, sell, hold) - from financial data
    -   follow fisher's principle to make decisions (buy price, sell price): independent of market value
        -   look at past results (3-5 years)
        -   patience to ride out unfavorable environment in markets (beyond company's control)
    -   change in economy -> make prediction go wrong 
        -   new tech, new regulation (true company reinvents)
        -   Godrej moved from typewriters, ITC from cigarettes
    
-   Intrinsic value of a company:
    -   independent of market price (past earnings)
    -   account: past earnings, future projected earnings (5-6 years)
        -   past valuations - is it fair 
        -   whether company lends itself to valuation (available data, predictable growth and earnings, comparable data with competitors, business model)
        -   imperfect valuation - better than no valuation (not false valuation)
        -   how much has one left in the valuation process for diversification and margin of safety 
    -   correct value of a stock: an informed buyer would sell to an informed seller
    -   distorted valuation: promoter (high salaries), promoter shell companies, take fee using today's valuation - instead of transaction data
    -   Indian public sectors (power: controlled by government policies)
        -   investors at risk
        -   share below intrinsic value (range): accumulate
        -   some cases: estimated intrinsic value greater - hold and sell
        -   also note book value (banks: highly liquid, asset: loan) - less than book value - acquire + dividends
        -   ideal value to sell: above intrinsic value
    margin of safety:
        -   diff b/w price paid and least price in the range of intrinsic value (fundamental analysis)
        -   lower the price of share than intrinsic value: greater the safety margin
        -   best margin of safety: when stock plummets (blood bath - sell everywhere - fear and panic)
        -   returns > FD returns - good! (interest rate cut down -> tata motors profit will increase more) + dividends
        -   when earning increase, price same : more margin of safety
        -   caveat: large cap, track: more than 10 years
        -   margin of safety: not meaning no loss (minimum loss)
        -   undervalued (PSU) banking stocks: growth potential, dividend (govt pressure) : less risk, inflation hedge : defensive investing
        -   when pay high - chances of losing, no guarantee stock will perform even next year as it done previous year
        -   eg: Real estate, infra (mythical net asset value) - investor forgets senses and buy
            -   valuing using order book and order flow - with out no idea on profitability, liquidity, debts, ability to finish contract
            -   Real estate, infra companies - mostly operate on debt - Interest cycle is must
            -   Consider ability to complete
            -   how people buy growth stocks : assume future earnings > present earnings
            -   what matters: history (but with caution - it may or may not happen)
            -   danger in growth stocks: trading at premium (so fall will be big)
        -   one way of safety: diversification
        -   one can't avoid losses - only reduce
        -   say 50% loss, even market grow at 5% -> 16 years to near the previous high
    Psychology:
        -   Make up the mind: no control over outcomes, understand consequences
        -   proper mitigation mechanisms (diversify, stop loss)
        -   most advisors: one in the herd - follow the losing side
    speculation and investment:
        -   speculation: assume it may increase or decrease - buy / sell / short
        -   for someone to gain someone must lose
        -   bond lose / gain value to adjust against interest rates
            -   increase IR - old becomes less attractive as new one - has more value
        -   speculator: valuable stock (new untapped sector) - value increases, popularity increases, tough times: speculator notes the weakness, price falls
        -   A good investor: wait for growing (not sell when speculator sell)
        -   Housing, automobile: done like contract (pay small amount, EMI) - except unlike options - verification is done
        -   options - a small swing wipe out entire capital (5% advance is enough) + commission + taxes - more 
        -   IFHF - enter in greed, act out of ignorance, live in hope, exit in fear
        -   herd - just run as others run (reason for panic - unknown) -> such panic doesn't help in market as in jungle
-   12 principles of philip carret for speculative investment:
    1. Never hold < 10 stock (covering 5-6 sectors)
        -   when sector is affected - you are at risk
    2. Monitor, review portfolio - twice a year - review at least in six months
        -   will I buy even today? - does it has quality
        -   why 6 months - done often -> useless (fear investing always makes loses)
    3. Invest atleast 50% of the money in income providing securities:
    4. yield - least important part of investment (regular returns - SM is not good)
        -   goal: emergency, education -> not good (keep liquid)
        -   dividend paying companies:
            -   high quality, good promoter - low yield but good future
            -   low quality, high yield - don't grow as don't reinvest
            -   high price. little dividend: may head for a decline period
            -   neither grow / nor dividend - no growth potential
    5. cut losses and ride profits:
        -   better return (feel) - sell some stock and park in another one
            -   undervalued? earning, asset increase steadily? valuation increase?
        -   no personal emergency -> only reason to sell -> change in fundamentals
        -   change in fundamentals (IVRCL infra):
            -   good with subsidiaries - infra, road, irrigation projects
            -   problems:
                -   Andhra CM died - vacuum in leadership
                -   Telangana problem
                -   Raising interest rate
    6. never put money - data not available
        -   manipulation, stock only exist on paper - false info - too small to track companies
        -   place to FIIs and then DIIs
        -   IPO: why they need money (always check and act)
    7. Avoid insider info trading:
        -   may be manipulators - always do research
    8. Seek facts diligently and never act on advice
        -   advice - biased, not long lasting - news channels, ad - commercial interest
        -   convenient headlines
        -   profits - made by speculating future earning not news
    9. Ignore mechanical formula for valuation:
        -   P/E - to buy / sell - do research
        -   sometimes better to buy high P/E than lower (L&T than IVRCL)
    10. when markets at all time high - sell 50% at park in cash/ debt - short term
        -   no one can predict lowest point - just buy low quantities
        -   if long term story intact - don't sell - good stock ride comfortably
    11. Borrow money when markets are down and business is depressed
        -   never borrow to invest
    12. 20% money from capital - common stocks - promising
        -   allocate money - struggling companies (not due to fundamentals)
-   Types of investors:
    -   government uses various savings schemes money - fund debt, consumption
    -   give subsidies (inflow), but also reduce purchase power - more inflation - more borrowing
    -   consider % of allocation - based on time
-   Defensive investing rules:
    -   diversify - sector and stock wise (5 sectors, 30 stocks)
    -   large cap, large turn over + moats (1 st or second in market position)
    -   minimum debt (common rule: reserves + owners's funds = twice of debt, debentures, preferred stocks)
    -   25 or more years of existence, pay dividends from a long time
    -   not 1 stock > 20% of portfolio, sector < 40%
    -   bank: see book value. No stocks: wait for opportunity
-   SIP:
    -   NYSC introduced this first. (caveat: large cap - index)
change in portfolio: 
    -   constant trading - churns your capital
    -   growth stock - may double in 5 years. But when fall - lose more (As trading in premium)
    -   Pretending stock - lose more and more
-   Buy what you know:
    -   advantage: can understand business and products
    -   too high - wait for correction.
    -   always continue lookout.
- Why not 100% in equities:
    -   not advisable more than 75%
    -   who can 100%:
        -   no emi, no need (short term, rent), own a house, can wait min 10 years, bought more in low, sleep peacefully - even in a crash
-   **enterprising investor:**
    -   one who buy small and mid cap, always watch market (time)
    -   speculate in futures and options, find and exploit PSU stocks
-   **small and mid cap:**
    -   media - made bullish some rubbish stocks
    -   IPO/ QIP: pass the parcel (make bullish, sell)
    -   Narayana murthy - lost 70% equity (SKS micro finance) - 3 years lock in
-   **Impact cost in futures:**
    -   no seller (won't order placed on current price)
    -   system bids 10 paise more on each share
        -   want to buy 1500 shares (sell: 1000@99, 1500@100, 1000@101), (buy: 1000@98, 2000@97, 1000@96)
        -   ideal price = (best buy + best sell)/2 = 99 + 98 / 2 = 98.5
        -   actual: 1000@99 + 500@100 / 1500 = 99.33 / share (avg)
        -   impact cost: 0.84% (when lower liquidity, more impact cost)
        -   impact cost = **Impact Cost**:\[
\text{Impact Cost} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Transaction Price} - \text{Mid-Price}}{\text{Mid-Price}} \right) \times 100 \]
        -   more actively trade - more lose to tax and brokers
-   **Options are like insurance product:**
    -   life of option: 30days
    -   longer the option time: more chance of win (india: high premium for more than 1 months)
-   **Opportunities in PSU:**
    -   govt can change rules
    -   major (oil, fertilizer, coal, power, finance) - decided by ministers - loss will be on minority traders
    -   dynamic pricing - but india it is not!
    -   state govt - won't privatize the power sector - as control will lose
    -   agriculture, other weaker sections - free electricity - more debt
    -   No transparent price discovery, selling at low prices - making losses
    -   most coal: imported (US dollar), not operating in full capacity (plants)
    -   India - one of the few large markets - bond market with high quality
-   **finance sector:**
    -   controlled by ministry of finance - largest borrower
    -   using Fin institutions to piggy bank deficits
    -   all psu must hold govt bonds beyond maturity (doesn't cover the cost of deposit)- huge loss of opportunity for psu
    -   govt controls interest rate on bonds. makes legislation - making due recovery hard for private sectors - loss
    -   LIC: bails out sectors - using public money (breach of IRDA - insurance)-> controlled by finance ministry
-   **Look out:**
-   **Good returns:**
    -   large companies - unpopular with investors (different sector than the bubble)
    -   temporary factors: management decisions
    -   idea: see sales, cap, profit, debt - why unpopular, will rectified
    -   care: avoid stocks like satyam, DLF, Uni tech
    -   Find market's ignorance, judge - exploit
-   **bargain issues:**
    -   time of panic - cheap, market mostly value on mood - not on intrinsic value
    -   method to identify: 
        -   appraisal (last 4 year earnings, find abnormality in fundamentals)
            -   estimate future earning if issue resolved
        -   similar to first one - more focus to realizable asset (net current asset and working capital)
            -   some other company can buy seeing the potential
            -   market can - setback a company for a small issue
    -   Judge temporary or permanent:
        -   cyclic stocks: buy at low and sell at high (metal, cement)
        -   But most of them are not cyclic
        -   Any wrong doings, issues with business, fundamentals, promoter, sector
-   bargain mid cap stocks:
    -   worst affected in panic
    -   mid cap - relatively large (bull market / acquired by others)
    -   indus ind: bad promoter, when changed - turn around
-   special situations:
    -   large cap acquires small / mid cap (price increase) - even failed
    -   legal actions in foreign (patent violation) - NATCO
    -   Tata motors:
        -   offered DVR - 1/10 th of voting rights - no need to dilute stake
        -   2008 crisis - not subscribed - need to fund from their own pocket + raising interest rate
        -   2011: 55-60% discount (DVR) - reason: excess supply of shares (company good)
-   Wild swings:
    -   violent swings - market close (2007 -> 3 down, 2 up swings)
    -   INKTOMI (search engine company - NYSE):
        -   2000-2002 (booming) - hit high, 1900% returns, tripled then..
        -   news: turn over 36 million, can hit 60 billion in 5 year
        -   what not know: loss increasing, no profit ever. 2000: valuation: 25 billion
        -   2002: stock went to 25 cents from 231 dollars (company still existed)
        -   neither valuation of 231$ and 25 cents is not right - but market is like this
        -   yahoo bought the company 
        -   stock valuation is different from company valuation: M&M bought satyam 5 times (11.50 : trading, bough at 88)
    -   no one predicted the market
-   how experts living:
    -   aim to make quick money - is their source of food
-   value company:
    -   method:1 net worth by assessing net asset, net cash, owner integrity
    -   method:2 compare net profit / EBITDA, calculate market cap by free float method
    -   compare with 10 year government security 
        -   EBITDA: when debt (depreciation, interest cost high) - consumer goods
        -   net profit: service sector
    free float method:
        -   capital invested = no of shares -  market price
        -   free float method: number of shares = total - shares owned by promoter
        -   bull market: value depend on mood, when market expectation missed - punished
-   Mind of an investor:
    -   human mind: see patterns (release dopamine) - even no pattern, tries to make up one
    -   leads to gambling (cricket - no pattern), market - few times up
    -   technical analysis: can give mood info (pain of lose hurt twice than profit in market)
    -   fear - sell instead of buying
    -   study: people who track the market make half of who don't
    -   Intelligent: buy when company is in trouble, don't when performing well
    -   Take contrarian approach, favour dumped stock, dump favoured stocks by market

-   good investor:    
    -   read from last to first page, calculate ratios
    -   look at foreign exchange - external borrowing, foreign currency convertible bonds (when rupee depreciates by 20%, their debt also goes up by 20%)
    -   profit / loss - foreign exchange - must be shown in P&L
    -   FCCB - management think no need to pay cash, when condition worsen: no body wants share, want money (depreciated rupee - more losses)
    -   consolidated results - true picture than standalone numbers
    -   FCCB - need to dilute stocks - EPS will decrease
    -   Transparency is must, how much bad news the company is willing to share
-   Balance sheet analysis:
    -   On closing day - asset, liability info
    -   parts: asset, equity, liability (secured loan, unsecured loan)
    -   secured loan: collateral (low interest, risk of losing)
    -   unsecured loan: based on credit worthiness, high interest
    -   Indian company: liability and shareholder's equity are grouped together (source of funds), asset (application of funds)
    -   Reserves and surplus: capital reserves, retained earnings, or any surplus from issuing shares at a premium.
-   Fixed asset sections: 
    -   gross : total assets (not for sale), compare between years (cost of machinery, asset growth)
    -   accumulated depreciation and amortization (not a cash expense)
        -   depreciation: applied to fixed assets
        -   amortization: applied to intangible assets (goodwill, patents)

    -   current liability: short term credit, bills
    -   net current asset: current asset - current liability (invest / buy / dividend)
    -   book value: net worth per share 
-   Six important points:
    -   How much capital - invested (incase opportunity can use it to acquire business)
    -   How much capital - no need to borrow, sell equity / give fresh equity
    -   compare P&L and balance sheet - 
        -   development expenses are amortized over years as expenses

    -   balance sheet figure: measure returns per share - compare
    -   earnings in relation with asset value and net worth, earning: (from business, investment and other activities)
    -   study capital structure, self reliance (no borrow), can pay credit or dividend
    -   when large debt > net current asset -> caution - sooner when interest rate increases - cost increase - problem
        -   suzlon: low interest rate: reckless borrowing, increasing book order, issued FCCB, acquired foreign companies
        -   pantaloon: borrowed and expanded retail - finally selling other assets to fund pantaloon
        -   king fisher: lease, fuel, salary (dollar) - gone bankrupt
        -   punj lloyd: acquisition, loans - company tried to acquired - not good (Libya projects)
    -   quality auditor: will have found - net asset decreased by 50% (due to dollar loans - no one wanted shares)
real estate stocks and debts:
    -   vanguard of bubble, sell more loan, more debt funds - interest rate is low
    -   when tightens - defaulters, bubble
    -   analysis of balance sheet of real estate or financial or infra - must
-   Profit and loss statement:
    -   sales, taxes, expenses
    -   gross sales: after tax deduction

            -   Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and amortization

    -   Net profit: useful in EPS, Net Profit Margin (NPM: profit as percentage of net sales, EPS: amount added to book value next year less dividend)
    -   Dividend: taxable at source, rest of profit: carry forward to balance sheet
    -   non cash expense: depreciation, amortization (tax planning)
        -   examine salary paid to promoter and relatives
    -   Important info:
        -   discount, goods returned stated clearly (recall, repair, glitches): eg: Intel pentium
        -   sales to subsidiaries - separately (judge how independent) - book cooking
        -   no mismatches in inventory, inventory valuation, nature of profit
        -   where purchases - from relations?
        -   dividend: dividend income, subsidiaries income - separate
        -   other income: lease, investment, purchase / sell of companies, assets, any extra payment to promoter
        -   history of P&L: can project
-   Cash statement:
    -   life blood - money.
    -   company may be profitable but has negative balance
    -   unnecessary debt (not for capital) - bad. True picture of company's position
    -   companies go bankrupt - no liquidity not because they are not profitable
    -   cash flow from 
        -   operations: interest/ income from listed or unlisted securities (before tax, non cash expenses (depreciation, amortization, loss or profit from unrealized currency exchange))
        -   investment: sale of prior investment or outflow for fresh investment
        -   financial activities: raise money from debt or equity 
    -   discounted cash flow:
        -   money in hand today > money accrued.
        -   fantasy: projections on future earnings
            -   convince bankers, debt investors - pessimism
            -   avoid acquired by other company, when share value plummets
        -   return on capital investment. Nothing like transparent valuation (assumptions are there)
-   Notes to account and auditor's report:
    -   basis of preparation, consolidated statement of accounts
        -   info on other income
        -   third party transaction
        -   foreign subsidiaries book of accounts
        -   asset, liability in foreign currency, hedging, derivatives

        -   auditor quality, any discontinued investor
-   Auditor's report:
    -   books prepared by the company: audited by CA (certify - book, report)
    -   independent valuation (difference opinion: must mention)
    -   punj lloyd:
        -   auditors published several qualifications in their report
        -   if applied to statement of accounts - books value reduced by 50%
    -   king fisher:
        -   noted - company won't be considered as going concern unless promoter brought in fresh equity
        -   repairs can't be capitalized, not remitted tax
    -   central bank of india:
        -   declared profit, dividends (govt of india, share holders)
        -   not provided pension and gratuity as per RBI norms
    -   sometimes: better to takes loss and exit than lose everything
    -   examine - no serious problems - buy 
    -   annual report: management on right track
-   note on equity funds in the balance sheet:
    -   reason for failure: lack of capital, excess debt
    -   too much capital (equity + retained earnings) - problem (reduced return)
    -   TCS: acquired many, Infosys: parked money
    -   sometimes - due to depressed state: may be below book value
    -   successful company: deploy money and generate more
    -   sometimes: better to let go (air india)
        -   bailed out using tax payers money - loss
        -   better judgement: sale not put more money
        -   public sector: lack of accountability, weak management 
        -   good sell: punjab bank to HDFC (when expansion is tough)
    -   consider:
        -   profitable, ROE
        -   avoid when working independent of profit (govt), assured bonus, low working hours, pension - even not profitable
        -   management is competent, share holders - can put pressure (even after listing - govt decided coal price - low)
        -   company must have pipeline of products to sell (even if sale decreased)
    -   market price: mood of the market (not based on business value)
        -   sometimes - market is very nervous, media paints ugly picture
        -   small cap / mid: sell (may look foolish - when increase) but broke when goes down
    -   value above price, specific pessimism (sometimes even good - not good enough for experts)
-   why technical analysis won't work:
    -   charts - pattern suggest course in the past (not sure in future)
    -   chart reading - not a science, can't predict (when many use charts - waste)
    -   practice can't be continuously successful - many copy - won;t work
    -   theory: 
        -   direction: based on interested participants (psychology, market conditions)
        -   24*7 news: if so profitable - must be mystery 
        -   all would be buffet, peter lynch, fisher, carret, soros, templeton 
    -   fundamental: using math, book value, roe, roc (for years)
    -   chartist and stop loss: 
        -   wants profit everyday, stop loss: escape stratergy
        -   investor: market - pick and manage stocks, liquidity to buy (take small bets - undervalued stocks)
        -   review portfolio once a month or quarter 
        -   you can't control profit but losses

## chapter 6 : Ratios:
-   garbage fed, garbage out (no particular reference point)
-   buffet- not bought tech stocks 2000, still richest, doing well
-   IBM (less failure rate than google or apple). market has higher expectations
-   ratios: judge capacity of earning, solvency, net worth
    -   when blood: more valuable, attractive, below book value
    -   out of favor stocks - identified using ratios
-   book value:
    -   what share holder would receive if liquidated and all creditors settled
    -   net worth = equity + asset - liability
    -   book value = net worth / no of shares
-   asset values and investment values:
    -   After narasimham committee - must specify not performing asset, collected, non collected interest, unrecoverable fund
    -   before 1991 - bonds always held till maturity - nobody knows how much floating bonds
    -   bonds: liability of the bank (private sector bank: better loan books)
    -   net interest margin: rate funds loaned - cost of fund
    -   Intangibles and valuation: 1991 (followed india - process patent), only physical asset are assets
    -   must depreciate, income from goodwill etc : must after 1991 - considered
-   who uses book value:
    -   finance sector (asset - loan book)
    -   public utilities (guarantee min return)
    -   avoid companies with negative net current asset
    -   net current asset = CA - CL (pantaloon), tata, aditya birla (exceptions - can pay from other group companies)
    -   sterilite:
        -   equity: 336.12 cr, reserves: 41,0099.36 cr
        -   debt per share: 34.89
        -   336.12 + 410099.36 / 336.12 (no of shares) = 123.32 - 34.89 = 88.43
        -   EPS = 23, current alternative book value = 123.32 + 23 = 146.32 (without reducing debt) 
    -   Dr reddy:
        -   equity = 84.6, reserves = 5935.6, no of shares = 16.92 (face value = 5)
        -   84.6 + 5935.6 / 16.92 = 355.8
        -   secured + unsecured loans = 1441.1 + 7
        -   debt / share = 85.7, book value = 270.1
        -   minus dividend per share, plus EPS
-   Earnings:
    -   from P&L: EBITDA, net profit after tax
    -   EPS = net profit / no of shares
    -   cash earnings per share = EBITDA / no of shares
    -   Estimate future earnings using assets (tangible and intangible), draw trend, extrapolate
    -   note: future is uncertain
        -   safety of price paid
        -   diversify as hedge
    -   boom and lean period: judge companies, resilience
    -   environment and business factors affecting the company (short term, long term)
-   factors:
    -   volume of sales
    -   price realized by sales
    -   cost of production
-   any development in the above factors: good
-   product line change:
    -   whoever bids low - but coal price - coal india take turn - govt unwilling to intervene
    -   some close the door - when faced loss, while bajaj turned fortune with joint venture with kawasaki
    -   reason: product line change (tata tea: starbucks - coffee retail joint venture, pepsico)
-   special advantage:
    -   not due to regulator (PSU banks), but exposed faced competition - shut down
    -   change in management can bring fortune (some fortune, some closed the entire group (kingfisher))
-   deal with deficit earnings:
    -   bad year - when indications (conditions will improve) - ignore
    -   eg: dr reddy (regulation in germany - writeoff good will writeoff, sold generics business)
    -   tata motors: heavy loss - passenger car development
-   ITC: regular profit increase, new markets
-   bajaj auto: 
    -   auto companies: sensitive to interest rate
    -   bajaj: high margin, exports, negligible debt (quantitative and qualitative factors)
-   PE or ROX:
    -   markets don't know everything, irrational, ignore fact but on emotions
    -   buy when depressed, sell at high, buy at low
    -   PE = market value / EPS (compare PE over time), other companies in the sector
    -   may be temporary PE - compared with history
        -   PEG = (P/E ratio) / Annual EPS growth rate
        -   1 = fair, < 1 : undervalued, > 1 : over valued
        -   ITC (EPS growth = 23%) -> 28.7 / 23 = 1.25 (overvalued)
-   price to sales ratio:
    -   PSR = market cap / (sales - taxes)
    -   taxes: excise, custom duty, vat
    -   PSR < 1 : ideal to enter. don't buy > 2.5, sell > 6 PSR
    -   PSR of large cap are lower than PSR of small companies
    -   ITC: 781.84 -  231 / 2917952 = 6.18
-   return on invested capital (ROIC):
    -   ROIC = net profit / (equity + borrowings)
    -   ability to deliver returns (expressed as percentage)
-   return on capital employed:
    -   ROCE: EBITDA / (equity funds + borrowings) -   100
    -   ROE = net profit / share holder funds
    -   Return at market price = net profit / market cap - 100
-   high growth stock: market chases - price goes up - low returns (can't satisfy market)
-   high growth stock - usually high price - useless to buy at such price
-   net profit expands - 20% -> easily double rate of returns excluding dividends
-   dividend yield:
    -   (dividend / share price) - 100
    -   dividend payout ratio = (dividend / EPS) - 100
    -   troubled companies pay more dividend
    -   investor: choose company better use of profit than dividend
    -   when too much cash, no dividend: without expansion / acquisition - problem
    -   when invested in low value return expansion - problem
